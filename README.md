# GitLabelWizard

### Status
- 21/01/2019
We have been working on a bash script that reads a yml file and do a HTTP POST request(cURL) to www.api.github.com to excute creation of labels in a repo

### Todo
Alot 

### Ideas
(Need more details. will be written later)
- Docker container to run the script locally
- Using CircleCI to excute the script
- Using CircleCI to perform a request to a serverless(server) that excutes the label creation
