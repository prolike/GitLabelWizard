# GitLabelWizard [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/prolike/GitLabelWizard/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/prolike/GitLabelWizard/tree/master) [![GitHub issues open](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Prolike/gitlabelwizard.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/prolike/GitLabelWizard/issues)

GitLabelWizard is a tool designed to automatically create and delete GitHub issue labels upon the creation of a new GitHub repository. This is done by using a GitHub app ([GitLabelWizardBot](https://github.com/apps/gitlabelwizardbot)) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) Cloud Functions, which will manipulate labels through [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/labels/).


## Background
Originally we started this project on AWS Lambda where we almost finished a working product written in Python 3. Though, due to complications with local testing of Lambda and CircleCI implementation, we decided to move to Firebase, which meant that we had to rewrite our codebase to Javascript (Nodejs). We have included the old codebase [here](https://github.com/prolike/GitLabelWizard/tree/master/backup).

## GitLabelWizard REST API documentation

#### REST API HTTP Request

* **Params** : `api_key`
* **Method** : `POST`
* **Accepts** : `application/json`  

#### JSON FORMAT

```JSON
{
  "action": "created",
  "repository": {
    "name": "{YOUR_REPO_NAME}",
    "owner": {
      "login": "{REPO_OWNER_NAME}"
    }
  }
}
```
## Prerequisites
```
1. A Firebase account with a Blaze plan* 
* You need a account with blaze plan to be have any outbound connection,
but no worries it will be almost free anyway.
2. A Firebase project
3. Git & Node.js installed
``` 
## Prepare your setup

We will go though some few steps to prepare the setup that will run the GitLabelWizard Bot. 

#### 1. Create a firebase account
Visit the link, and create a account for yourself
- https://firebase.google.com/

#### 2. Create a new project
You will now enter the console panel for your firebase account, and create a new project, and assign a name to the project.
We will be using this project as our serverless/cloud functions service to doing label manipulation in a Github repository. 

#### 3. Find your ProjectID
Enter your firebase project ->  Click project settings -> There you can find your **project ID**
Save the **ProjectID** for later use in installation. 

## Installation


#### 1. Clone github repo

Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/prolike/gitlabelwizard.git
```

#### 2. Install Node.js (Skip if you have already Node.js installed)

Download and install your Node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

#### 3. Configure firebase file

Open `GitLabelWizard/.firebasesrc` and change the default value to your **projectID**.
*You can find your projectID from your firebase console.*

```
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "gitlabelwizard-8a56d"
  }
}

```

#### 4. Install firebase tools

```
$ sudo npm install -g firebase-tools
```

#### 5. Install npm modules

```
$ cd GitLabelWizard/functions
$ cd sudo npm install
```


## Running the tests
To run the automated tests you need to be in the folder `GitLabelWizard/functions/`.
You have to make sure you have the `GitLabelWizard/functions/node_modules/` folder installed. If not, please run `npm install`. 

```
$ sudo npm install
```

You should now have the requirements to run the tests.

Make sure you're still inside `GitLabelWizard/functions/` and run
```
$ npm test
```
You should now see the test passes. 

## Running the firebase functions locally

You can now test your firebase function locally.
*Currently state:
The function will be invoked but not run correctly and will fail since the environment config is not yet set, we will do that later under deloyment. Read the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/local-emulator).*

If you want to invoke the functions locally as a API service, then run this command:
```
$ sudo firebase serve
```

If you want to invoke the functions locally as a functions, then run this command:
```
$ sudo firebase functions:shell
```



## Deployment guideline 

In order to deploy the project into a firebase functions, you need to generate 3 tokens:
* RANDOM_GENERATED_API_KEY
* GITHUB_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN
* FIREBASE_TOKEN

#### 1 RANDOM_GENERATED_API_KEY
This token is your API_KEY for accessing the firebase functions.

Write following in your terminal/commandline
```bash
$ date +%s | sha256sum | base64 | head -c 32 ; echo 
```
You will get something like: 
`$ nGNiMDYzMWVjMmE2ZGYxNGZkNTJmMjYz`

This is your secret **RANDOM_GENERATED_API_KEY** for the project, save the api key and dont expose it someplace!

#### 2. GITHUB_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN
This token is your basic authentication token for github project (Base64)

Write following in your terminal/

```bash
$ echo yourgithubusername:yourgithubpassword | base64
```

You will get something like:
`$ eGF4YW5zdHhheGFzOnNhc2RICg==`

This is your secret **GITHUB_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN** for the project, save the key and dont expose it someplace!

#### 3. FIREBASE_TOKEN

This is your authentication token for firebase

Write following in your terminal/commandline

```
$ firebase login:ci
```

You will get prompted and redirected to a login screen for firebase, sign yourself in and then the token will be showed in terminal.

```
Waiting for authentication...

âœ”  Success! Use this token to login on a CI server:

1/_4hiNWKtrhWNmxIbM10PXH779BkRIvS5pn50JNtoNst

Example: firebase deploy --token "$FIREBASE_TOKEN"
```

This is your secret **FIREBASE_TOKEN** for the project, save the key and dont expose it someplace!

## Deployment

Hereby you have created a firebase project, installed the project locally and ran the test successfully.
Now your project is ready for the deployment to firebase cloud functions.
Run following commands to deploy.
```
$ firebase functions:config:set github.authkey={YOUR_GITHUB_BASIC_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN} --token={YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN_HERE}
$ firebase functions:config:set fb.apikey={YOUR_RANDOM_GENERATED_API_KEY} --token={YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN_HERE}
$ firebase deploy --only functions --token={YOUR_FIREBASE_TOKEN_HERE}
```

Now the firebase functions should be deployed and visible in firebase console panel under "functions". There you can aswell find the **HTTP URL** for api entrypoint. This url you will be using for setting up the **Webhook**.

## Implement the bot for your project

#### Using the bot as a webhook for the organization or repository

Goto the organization or repository and put your **HTTP URL** and concat it with your API URL.

* **Firebase functions URL:** `{YOUR FIREBASE FUNCTION URL}`

* **API Key:** `{YOUR_RANDOM_GENERATED_API_KEY}`

* **Param:** : `api_key`

* **Webhook URL:** : `{YOUR FIREBASE FUNCTION URL}?api_key={YOUR_RANDOM_GENERATED_API_KEY}`

So your webhook URL should look like: `https://us-central1-gitlabelwizard.cloudfunctions.net/helloWorld?api_key=nGNiMDYzMWVjMmE2ZGYxNGZkNTJmMjYz`

Insert your Webhook URL in your github organization or repository that you have **owner access** to.

* Organization : https://github.com/organizations/{YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME}/settings/hooks
* Repository : https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNTNAME}/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}/settings/hooks

## Future development
To expand this service, we would like to add the following features in the future:
- Instead of having the labels stored locally, we would want the labels to be in a YML-file, which the wizard then reads to create labels.
- To delete labels, we would then match the labels in the file to the existing labels on the repository and delete any labels not mentioned in the file. Here we would also ensure that the wizard only deletes labels that are not in use on any issue.
- When the YML-file is edited by the repository owner, the wizard will read the file again and then create or delete any labels added to or removed from the file.

Some of these features were actually already developed in the first part of the project when we were still running on AWS Lambda. The codebase (written in Python 3) can be found [here](https://github.com/prolike/GitLabelWizard/tree/master/backup).
